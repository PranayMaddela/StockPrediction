# üìà Stock Market Trend Prediction using ML & DL (Continuous vs Binary Analysis)

This project automates stock market trend prediction using modular Python scripts with GUI and CLI support. It applies 9 ML and 2 DL models (ANN, LSTM) on both continuous and binary-encoded stock data. Designed with future CI/CD integration and cloud scalability in mind, the system handles data preprocessing, training, and performance monitoring through HTML reports‚Äîideal for SRE-style observability and DevOps-ready pipelines.

## üìä Project Objective

Evaluate and compare 9 ML algorithms and 2 DL models (ANN & LSTM) across:
- **Continuous Price Data**
- **Binary Movement Data** (1 if current price > previous, else -1)
